# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** LLMエージェントが、静的な目的地指定だけでなく、動的に移動する主体に対しても一貫した状態遷移とイベント駆動で行動を継続できること

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: v1 completed when pursuit state and events work correctly, not when guaranteed capture exists
- Initialization: v1 target scope is players and monsters only
- Initialization: pursuit failures must carry structured reasons for LLM replanning

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Pursuit state must not be collapsed into static movement path state
- Busy-state timing and observation-driven movement interruption can conflict with pursuit continuation
- Async event failure visibility is weak in the current UoW/event pipeline
